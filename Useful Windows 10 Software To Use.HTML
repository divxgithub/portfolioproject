            <h2>Ueli</h2>
            <p>Windows 10 search is pretty decent but I don't blame anyone if anyone doesn't find it capable of using
                and that's where Ueli app comes in place, Ueli brings a launcher to windows which is very similar to mac
                spotlight all you have to do is press “alt + space” to launch it and then quickly launch apps files or
                search anything online, you can even calculate and do basic mathematical problem without opening
                calculator program. It is very powerful and very customizable. You can create a custom shortcut for your
                personal task and even customize the launcher preview.</p>
            <h2>Franz</h2>
            <p>Accessing your Email, whatsapp, sms, and messenger front our laptop or pc can quite be a difficult task
                here “Franz” can help, it is a cool application which lets you control all of these in one place, In
                Franz just add the social media service you often use and just login and start using everything in a
                single app, this app can help you in certain ways like if you’re a college student and it's your
